# DWRDVNCNTCVS Website Portfolio

This website was built using [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org) as its frontend. This application consists of the actual page where other people can publicly viewed and admin page where I can create or make changes to the page. For the backend of the application, I used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). With firebase, I use its storage, firestore and authentication to handle all the information I need for this application.

I used this approach where I added an admin page on the website to help me lessen the times I need to make commits when I want to add new information that I want to display on my application.
